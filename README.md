TECHNOLOGIES USED
BACKEND:
1. Golang with Gin Framework:
Golang is a statically-typed language known for its simplicity and efficiency.
Gin is a web framework written in Golang that provides a fast and minimalistic API for building web applications.
2. Cassandra Database with Gocql:
Cassandra is a highly scalable and distributed NoSQL database known for its performance.
Gocql is a Go driver for Cassandra, enabling efficient communication between the Golang backend and the Cassandra database.
FRONTEND:
HTML/CSS/JS:
The frontend is built using standard web technologies for simplicity and ease of integration.

DESIGN AND DEVELOPMENT DECISIONS

1. Backend Design:
-RESTful APIs:
The backend is designed to follow RESTful principles for easy integration with frontend applications and other systems.
-User Authentication and Authorization:
Secure user authentication is implemented with role-based access control (admin, teacher, student).
Certain endpoints require authentication for authorized access.
-Database Schema:
The Cassandra database is designed to store user data, course information, and enrollment details efficiently.
-Middleware:
Middleware functions are utilized for handling common tasks such as authentication checks, logging, and error handling.
2. Frontend Design:
-HTML Templates:
HTML templates are used for rendering views to ensure consistency and ease of maintenance.
-CSS Styling:
Simple CSS styling is applied for a clean and user-friendly interface.
-JavaScript for Dynamic Behavior:
JavaScript is employed to enhance user interactions, such as fetching and displaying course data dynamically.
